They ask you to help them make sense of it all by generating a report of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped using classification.

This assignment accomplishes the following main tasks:

* Data Preprocessing: 
    - Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.
* Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: 
    - After the completion of this task, the following dataframe is produced:
    
* Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means: 
    - Create an Elbow Curve to find the best value for k 
    - Once the best value for k is defined, the Kmeans algorithm is used to predict the k clusters for the cryptocurrencies data. 
    - Completion of this task results in the following dataframe:
    
* Visualizing Results: 
    Create some plots and data tables to present your results.

# Cryptocurrency Clustering

## Background Information

A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers, however, they are lost in the immense universe of cryptocurrencies. They ask you to help them make sense of it all by generating a report of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped using classification.

This assignment accomplishes the following main tasks:

* Data Preprocessing: 
    - Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.
* Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: 
    - Completion of this task results in the following dataframe:

* Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means: 
    - Create an Elbow Curve to find the best value for k.
    - Once the best value for k is defined, the Kmeans algorithm is used to predict the k clusters for the cryptocurrencies data. 
    - Completion of this task results in the following dataframe:

* Visualizing Results: 
    - Create a 3D-Scatter using Plotly Express to plot the clusters.
    - Use `hvplot.table` to create a data table with all the current tradable cryptocurrencies.
    - Create a scatter plot using `hvplot.scatter`, to present the clustered data about cryptocurrencies having `x="TotalCoinsMined"` and `y="TotalCoinSupply"` to contrast the number of available coins versus the total number of mined coins.
